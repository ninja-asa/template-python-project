# template-python-project
This is intended to be a repository to serve as a template to my own, and others projects using Python. 

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- Open the repository in VSCode
- Setup intended Python version in the `Dockerfile.dev`
- Press `F1` and type `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`
- Start developing

## Features
### Docker-based development
This is tuned for VSCode and to support container based development.

You will find the `.vscode` directory with the files needed to make it work. However, before starting to develop, check the `python` version in the `Dockerfile.dev` - ensure you are using a version that suits your needs.
